2. #include <stdio.h>

3. the difference is that printf takes const char *format and fprintf takes FILE *stream in addition to const char *format

4. printf() writes output to std-out while fprintf() write's output to the given output stream

5. Hello, world!

7. 2

8. #include <unistd.h>

11.

// Carter DeLargy // 2-17-2026 
// this writes hello world 
#include <stdio.h>
#include <unistd.h>

int main(int argc, char* argv[]) {
    write(STDOUT_FILENO,"Hello, world!\n",14);
    return 0;
}



10. When I try to compile it with gcc, it gives me an error that write is reading 1000 bytes from a region of size 15. 
This is because it can recognize the buffer I gave is much larger than the needed one.

11. i feel as though i would want to do a C standard library call like fprintf() most of the time because it is guaranteed to exist. 
this could be if i have a portable program that i want to be able to work anywhere. 
I might only want to do write() if it ends up being more efficient and i have a program that i know is working on something where the operating system has write().
