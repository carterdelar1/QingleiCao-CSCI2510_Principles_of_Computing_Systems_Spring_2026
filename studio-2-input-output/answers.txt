1. when you use cat and type something, it then repeats it back in a new line.

2. this fed the cat command the txt file, 
so it just output the entire txt file to the terminal.

3. in addition to outputting it to the terminal, it also
created a new.txt file with all the text from mars.txt

4. this makes it so instead of outputting my text in a new line each time,
it puts that text in a new line in new.txt

5. this works similarly, but cat >> new.txt continues from the first empty line,
instead of erasing it like cat > new.txt does.

6. i need to include <unist.h>

7. 

8. the return value type is an integer. a zero indicates the end of the file

9. yes, the programs behavior matches fully with cat. whatever you write is repeated.
it also works so if you do something like "./copy > new.txt" it will
write to the txt file.

10. i changed the buffersize to 1, and even with that i didn't notice a difference at all.
i feel as though maybe with larger files it could take longer with a smaller buffer.

11. a large buffer should have less system calls but it means
it's using more memory, which is a tradeoff

Optional Enrichment Exercises:

1. #include <stdio.h>
#include <unistd.h>

#define bufferSize 1
char buffer[bufferSize];
ssize_t cat_bytes;

int main() {
    while (fgets(buffer, bufferSize,stdin) != NULL) {
        fprintf(stdout, "%s", buffer);
    }

    return 0;
}

i did that here, using fgets() and fprintf() instead of read() and write().
